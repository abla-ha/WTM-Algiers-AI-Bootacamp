# Unsupervised Learning Workshop

Welcome to the Unsupervised Learning Workshop repository! This repository contains resources and code for understanding and implementing unsupervised learning techniques, focusing on clustering methods.

## Repository Contents

1. **Presentation**  
   The `Unsupervised_Learning_Workshop_Presentation.pdf` file contains a comprehensive presentation on unsupervised learning. This presentation covers the fundamentals, key concepts, and practical applications of various unsupervised learning techniques.

2. **Customer Segmentation with Clustering**  
   The `Customer_Segmentation_Clustering_Techniques.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the use of different clustering techniques for customer segmentation. We explore methods such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, comparing their effectiveness and suitability for different types of data.

3. **K-Means Implementation from Scratch**  
   The `KMeans_Implementation_From_Scratch.ipynb` notebook walks through the process of implementing the K-Means algorithm from scratch. This notebook helps you understand the inner workings of K-Means by breaking down the algorithm into simple, understandable steps.
